>An induction stove is an energy efficient and safe way to prepare meals. The burners on induction stoves are smooth and produce an electromagnetic field that reacts with the metal in your cookware. The heat from your pot or skillet is then transferred to the food inside. There are no open flames or messy burner trays to clean, and the stove top cools faster than traditional gas and electric stoves.

###Instructions
###Purchase the Stove

1.Decide what kind of induction stove meets your needs. An induction stove can replace your current gas or electric stove top, be installed into your counter or be purchased as a stove and oven combination.

2.Measure the area in your kitchen where the appliance will be installed to ensure a proper fit.

3.Research available stove brands and styles. Induction stoves were only available outside the United States until recently, so find a knowledgeable sales person to help you or visit a specialty website like the Induction Site, which sells induction stoves and also provides an overview of their use.

###Use an Induction Stove

4.Cook only with magnetic cookware such as cast iron or stainless steel. Without this type of cookware, the burner won't react with the metal and won't heat up.

5.Place your pot, pan or skillet on the burner and turn the heat knob to the desired heat setting. This increases the intensity of the heat just like setting an electric burner.

6.Prepare your food as usual. You don't have to adjust the way you cook on an induction stove. Induction cooking is just as easy as cooking on a gas or electric appliance.

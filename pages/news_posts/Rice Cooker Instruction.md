Total Time: 25 minutes


###Ingredients:

+ rice
+ water
+ rice cooker

###Preparation:

A rice cooker works by bringing the liquid to a boil very quickly. This happens because the cooker environment is sealed, reducing the air pressure over the liquid, so the liquid boils faster. Then, a temperature sensor monitors the heat inside the cooker. When it starts to rise above 212 degrees F (the boiling point of water), that means that the rice has absorbed all the liquid, and it switches to a 'warm' setting.

Follow the instructions that come with your rice cooker. For most cookers, combine 1-1/2 to 2 cups of liquid with 1 cup of rice; this will yield about 3 cups rice, or enough for 6 (1/2 cup) servings. The smaller amount is for separate, drier grains of rice. The larger amount results in rice that is stickier. Most rice cookers can keep the cooked rice warm for hours without burning.
